# XL6009

The regulator chip *XL6009* is a popular high-power *buck and boost* converter with a claimed maximum currency of **4A**. Today, it is often replaced by its successor *XL6019* which features a maximum currency of **5A*.

> Whether a board with *XL6009* works as a buck, boost, or book-and-boost converter depends on the board design. There are cheap boards for around €0.70/piece that do a one-way boost as well as more sophisticated boards for around €2 that do buck and boost.
> Typically, boards with just *one* coil element go just one way, and boards with *two* coil elements do buck and boost.

| Input | Output | Maximum Current | Switching Frequency | Cost for complete board |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3.2-32V | 4-38V | 4A | 400kHz | low (€ 0.70/piece for boost-only, € 2 for buck-boost) |
